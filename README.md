goPool is a from-scratch Go solo Bitcoin mining pool. It connects directly to
Bitcoin Core over JSON-RPC and ZMQ, exposes Stratum v1 with optional TLS, and
includes a status UI and JSON APIs for monitoring.

## What this project is

- A solo Bitcoin pool server written in Go from the ground up for this project.
- A direct integration with Bitcoin Core (no external pool engine dependency).
- A self-hosted stack: Stratum endpoint, web status UI, and JSON APIs.

## Feature highlights

- **Simple live dashboard** to quickly see pool health and mining activity.
- **Worker pages** so you can check each rig's speed and recent performance.
- **Online/offline status** so you can quickly see which miners are up or down.
- **Saved workers** so your favorite rigs are easy to revisit anytime.
- **24-hour hashrate charts** to spot drops, spikes, and stability trends.
- **Best share tracking** so you can see standout shares over time.
- **Discord pings** (optional): alerts when a saved worker goes offline, when it has been back online long enough to count as recovered, and when a saved worker finds a block.
- **Easy connect details** shown on the site for miner setup.

- **Solo mining core**: builds and submits Bitcoin blocks directly against Bitcoin Core (`getblocktemplate` + `submitblock`) with JSON-RPC and optional ZMQ acceleration.
- **Stratum v1 server**: supports `mining.subscribe`, `mining.authorize`, `mining.submit`, `mining.configure`, CKPool-style `mining.auth`, and optional Stratum TLS.
- **Compatibility controls**: CKPool subscribe-response emulation, version-rolling support, suggest-difficulty handling, optional `mining.set_extranonce` and `mining.set_version_mask` notifications.
- **Share-policy controls**: duplicate checks, nTime and version-rolling checks, worker-match enforcement, stale-job freshness modes, and optional inline submit processing.
- **VarDiff + hashrate telemetry**: configurable difficulty clamps/targets, EMA smoothing, worker/pool hashrate history, and best-share tracking.
- **Safety and resilience**: node/job-feed health gating (disconnect/refuse when unsafe), reconnect/invalid-submit banning, pending submission replay, and stale-feed safeguards.
- **Web status UI + JSON APIs**: live overview, node/pool/server pages, worker pages, and `/api/*` endpoints for monitoring/automation.
- **Operator controls**: optional admin panel for live settings updates, persist-to-disk controls, log tooling, and guarded reboot action.
- **Storage and backups**: SQLite state store with atomic snapshots and optional Backblaze B2 upload workflow.
- **Auth/integrations**: optional Clerk auth flows, saved-worker pages, Discord notification toggles, and one-time worker linking codes.
- **Performance options**: Stratum socket buffer tuning, optional SIMD JSON/hash paths, and built-in profiling hooks.

Stratum notes:

- goPool accepts both `mining.authorize` and CKPool-style `mining.auth`, and tolerates authorize-before-subscribe (work starts after subscribe completes).
- On startup and during runtime, Stratum is gated only when the node/job feed reports errors or the node is in a non-usable syncing/indexing state: new connections are refused and existing miners are disconnected to avoid wasted hashing.

## Benchmarks

Current `mining.submit` and `mining.notify` results for `100`, `1000`, and
`10000` miners are in [`benchmarks/go/`](benchmarks/go/). The heat map below is
from the August 15, 2026 production-profile rerun.

The production benchmark profile keeps normal submit-validation checks,
vardiff, telemetry, and startup maintenance enabled. Connection-rate limits and
invalid-submit bans are relaxed so synthetic `10000`-miner reject-load runs can
complete. All simulated connections use unique workers; per-share disk logging
is disabled while errors remain enabled; CPU pinning and scheduler limits are
not applied.

The reproducible suite supports goPool, pogolo, ckpool, dvb-WarpPool, and
public-pool.
It uses pogolo v1.1.4-hotfix, CKPool v1.2.0, WarpPool's `main` branch, and
public-pool's `master` branch. WarpPool is built unmodified with the stock
Enterprise profile; its 10,000-client rows are reported as failures because that profile's
shipped connection cap is 4,096.

## Quick start

1. Install Go 1.26.8 or later and ZeroMQ (`libzmq3-dev` or equivalent depending on your platform).
2. Clone the repo and build the pool:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/M45Core/M45-goPool.git
    cd M45-goPool
    go build -o goPool
    ```
3. Run `./goPool` once to generate example config files under `data/config/examples/`, then copy the base example into `data/config/config.toml` and edit it.
4. Set the required `node.payout_address`, `node.rpc_url`, and ZMQ addresses (`node.zmq_hashblock_addr`/`node.zmq_rawblock_addr`; leave empty to run RPC/longpoll-only) before restarting the pool.

## Containerization (Docker/Compose)

You can run goPool using Docker or Docker Compose for easy deployment and reproducibility.

### Build and run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t gopool:local .
docker run --rm -it \
  -e BUILD_TIME="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -e BUILD_VERSION="v0.0.0-dev" \
  -p 3333:3333 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" \
  gopool:local -stdout
```

### Using Docker Compose

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and adjust it as needed. Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build

docker compose logs -f

docker compose down
```

### Umbrel community-store releases

For the friendly install walkthrough, miner settings, fee disclosure, and
troubleshooting, visit [m45core.com/umbrel](https://m45core.com/umbrel).

Tagged releases are published automatically for both `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`. The release workflow pushes an immutable versioned image to
GitHub Container Registry, starts that exact image with deterministic demo
metrics, captures its current dashboard template and CSS for the Umbrel gallery,
then dispatches the image digest and screenshot URL to the
[M45Core Umbrel Community App Store](https://github.com/M45Core/M45-Umbrel-Community-App-Store).
The store verifies the source tag and image before committing its own app
version, release notes, and digest pin. This remains a community-store release;
it does not submit the app to Umbrel's official store.

The Umbrel package defaults to a 2% pool fee paid to
`3B86bWqfjdQeLEr8nkeeWU6ygksc2K7MoL`. When the worker supplies a valid payout
wallet through Stratum, the remaining 98% is paid to that wallet. The package
currently targets Bitcoin mainnet.

Add this community-store URL in the umbrelOS App Store UI:

```text
https://github.com/M45Core/M45-Umbrel-Community-App-Store
```

Create an `UMBREL_STORE_TOKEN` fine-grained token limited to the community-store
repository with Contents read/write access, then add it as an Actions secret in
both repositories. The source uses it to dispatch the release; the store uses
it to push the verified metadata update because the M45Core organization
enforces read-only built-in workflow tokens. The
`ghcr.io/m45core/m45-gopool` package must also be public so umbrelOS can pull it
without registry credentials. Once those one-time settings are in place,
pushing a semantic version tag such as `v0.1.1` creates the GitHub release,
multi-platform image, and community-store update. The workflow also supports a
manual run for an existing tag.

The source and Umbrel package can have independent versions. Before tagging, set
[`UMBREL_VERSION`](UMBREL_VERSION) to the package version you want umbrelOS to
display. Release `v0.1.1` updates the existing `0.1.0` bootstrap package and
keeps the source and Umbrel version numbers aligned.

For a checked release that runs the test suite, validates both version numbers,
creates an annotated tag, and pushes `main` plus the tag, use:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh v0.1.1
```

## Configuration overview

- `data/config/config.toml` controls listener ports, core branding, node endpoints, fee percentages, and most runtime behavior.
- TLS on the status UI is driven by `server.status_tls_listen` (default `:443`). Leave it empty (`""`) to disable HTTPS and rely solely on `server.status_listen` for HTTP; leaving `server.status_listen` empty disables HTTP entirely.
- `data/certbot-webroot/.well-known/acme-challenge/` is served on the status HTTP listener before HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects, so certbot HTTP-01 webroot validation can run while goPool is up. The bundled UI files under `data/www` are embedded into the goPool binary and are separate from this runtime certbot webroot.
- `data/config/config.toml` also covers bitcoind settings such as `node.rpc_url`, `node.rpc_cookie_path`, and ZMQ addresses (`node.zmq_hashblock_addr`/`node.zmq_rawblock_addr`; leave empty to disable ZMQ and rely on RPC/longpoll). First run writes helper examples to `data/config/examples/`.
- Optional split files:
  - `data/config/services.toml` for service/integration settings (`auth`, `backblaze_backup`, `discord`, `status` links).
  - `data/config/policy.toml` for submit-policy/version/bans/timeouts.
  - `data/config/tuning.toml` for rate limits, vardiff, EMA tuning, and peer-cleaning controls.
  - `data/config/version_bits.toml` for explicit per-bit block-version overrides (read-only; never rewritten by goPool). `data/config/policy.toml` `[version].share_allow_out_of_mask_version_bits` allows unnegotiated or out-of-mask miner submit versions for legacy compatibility (default `true`).
  - `data/config/secrets.toml` for sensitive credentials (RPC user/pass, Discord/Clerk secrets, Backblaze keys).
- `data/config/admin.toml` controls the optional admin UI at `/admin`. The file is auto-generated on first run with `enabled = false` and a random password (read the file to see the generated secret). Update it to enable the panel, pick fresh credentials, and keep the file private. goPool writes `password_sha256` on startup and clears the plaintext password after the first successful login; subsequent logins use the hash. The admin UI provides a field-based editor for the in-memory config, can force-write `config.toml` + split override files, and includes a reboot control; reboot requests require typing `REBOOT` and resubmitting the admin password.
- `[logging]` uses boolean toggles: `debug` enables verbose runtime logs, and `net_debug` enables raw network tracing (`net-debug.log`). You can also force these at startup with `-debug` and `-net-debug`.
- `share_*` validation toggles live in `data/config/policy.toml` `[mining]` (for example `share_check_duplicate`).

Flags like `-network`, `-rpc-url`, `-rpc-cookie`, and `-secrets` override the corresponding config file values for a single run—they are not written back to `config.toml`.

## Building

- Build directly with `go build -o goPool`. Use hardware-acceleration tags such as `noavx` or `nojsonsimd` only when necessary; see [documentation/operations.md](documentation/operations.md) for guidance.
- GitHub Releases provide source archives only; build the executable locally.
- To embed `build_time` and `build_version`, pass them with `-ldflags`:

  ```bash
  go build -ldflags="-X main.buildTime=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) -X main.buildVersion=v0.0.0-dev" -o goPool
  ```
