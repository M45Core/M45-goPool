# goPool Operations Documentation

For initial setup, start with the [main README](../README.md). This guide covers
day-to-day operation and configuration.

goPool connects directly to Bitcoin Core over JSON-RPC and ZMQ, hosts a Stratum
v1 endpoint, and exposes a status UI with JSON APIs. See the
[testing guide](TESTING.md) for test and profiling workflows.

Operational Stratum notes:

- Stratum is gated (at startup and during runtime) only when the job feed reports errors or the node is in a non-usable syncing/indexing state. While gated, new miner connections are refused and existing miners are disconnected to avoid idling on stale/no work during node/bootstrap issues.
- When the node/job feed is stale, the main status page (`/`) displays a dedicated "node unavailable" page instead of the normal overview.
- A background heartbeat (`stratumHeartbeatInterval`) performs periodic non-longpoll template refreshes so "quiet mempool / no template churn" does not look like a dead node.
- When updates are degraded but basic node RPC calls still work, the node-unavailable page will also show common sync/indexing indicators (IBD flag and blocks/headers) to help diagnose "node indexing" situations.

## Containerization (Docker/Compose)

goPool provides a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployments. This is the recommended way to run in production or for easy local testing.

### Building and running with Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t gopool:local .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e BUILD_TIME="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -e BUILD_VERSION="v0.0.0-dev" \
  -p 3333:3333 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" \
  gopool:local -stdout
```

### Using Docker Compose

Copy `env.example` to `.env`, then adjust ports, build arguments, and runtime
flags as needed:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will build and start the container, mapping ports and mounting `./data` for persistent config/state.

### Build arguments and environment variables

- `BUILD_TIME` and `BUILD_VERSION` are passed to the Docker build from `.env`.
- Runtime environment variables (see `env.example`) control ports, network mode, and extra flags.

### Persistent data

The `data` directory is mounted into the container at `/app/data` to persist configuration, logs, and state. Always back up this directory.

## Native build

Requirements:

- **Go 1.26.10+** — install from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/).
- **ZeroMQ headers** (`libzmq3-dev`, `zeromq`, etc.) for
  `github.com/pebbe/zmq4`. On Debian or Ubuntu, run
  `sudo apt install -y libzmq3-dev`.

Clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M45Core/M45-goPool.git
cd M45-goPool
go build -o goPool
```

Use `GOOS`/`GOARCH` for cross-compilation and avoid `go install` unless populating `GOBIN` intentionally. Hardware acceleration flags (`noavx`, `nojsonsimd`) remain the only build tags you usually need; runtime logging/tracing is controlled by `[logging].debug` and `[logging].net_debug` (or `-debug` / `-net-debug`).

### Build metadata

Builds can embed two fields via `-ldflags`:

- `main.buildTime`: the UTC timestamp recorded when the binary was compiled. The status UI exposes it as `build_time`.
- `main.buildVersion`: the version label (e.g., `v1.2.3`) and shows up under `build_version`.

The helper script `scripts/build-pool.sh` sets both fields automatically. To
set them directly, pass the same flags to `go build`:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-X main.buildTime=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) -X main.buildVersion=vX.Y.Z" -o goPool .
```

Both values appear on the status page and JSON endpoints so you can verify the exact build at runtime.

## Starting the pool

1. Run `./goPool` once; it generates `data/config/examples/` and exits.
2. Copy `data/config/examples/config.toml.example` to `data/config/config.toml`.
3. Set required values in `config.toml` (especially `node.payout_address`, `node.rpc_url`, and optional `node.zmq_hashblock_addr`/`node.zmq_rawblock_addr`).
4. Optional: copy split files from `data/config/examples/` into `data/config/` (`secrets.toml`, `services.toml`, `policy.toml`, `tuning.toml`, `version_bits.toml`) when you need overrides.
5. Start goPool again with `./goPool`.

| `-miner-profile-json <path>` | Write aggregated miner profile JSON to a file for offline tuning. |
| `-saved-workers-local-noauth` | Allow saved-worker pages without Clerk auth (local single-user mode). |

Flags only override values for the running instance; nothing is written back to `config.toml` (except `node.rpc_cookie_path` when auto-detected). Use configuration files for durable behavior.

## Configuration files

### config.toml

The required `data/config/config.toml` is the primary interface for pool behavior. Key sections include:

- `[server]`: `pool_listen`, `status_listen`, `status_tls_listen`, and `status_public_url`. Set `status_tls_listen = ""` to disable HTTPS and rely on `status_listen` only. Leaving `status_listen` empty disables HTTP entirely (e.g., TLS-only deployments). `status_public_url` feeds redirects and Clerk cookie domains. When both HTTP and HTTPS are enabled, the HTTP listener now issues a temporary (307) redirect to the HTTPS endpoint so the public UI and JSON APIs stay behind TLS.
- `[branding]`: Styling and branding options shown in the status UI (tagline, pool donation link, location string).
- `[stratum]`: `stratum_tls_listen` for TLS-enabled Stratum (leave blank to disable secure Stratum), plus `stratum_password_enabled`/`stratum_password` to require a shared password on `mining.authorize`, and `stratum_password_public` to show the password on the public connect panel.
- `policy.toml [stratum]`: `ckpool_emulate` controls CKPool-style subscribe response compatibility.
- `tuning.toml [stratum]`: `tcp_read_buffer_bytes` and `tcp_write_buffer_bytes` control Stratum socket buffer tuning.
- Optional runtime overrides (temporary): `-ckpool-emulate`, `-stratum-tcp-read-buffer`, and `-stratum-tcp-write-buffer`.
- `[node]`: `rpc_url`, `rpc_cookie_path`, and ZMQ addresses (`zmq_hashblock_addr`/`zmq_rawblock_addr`).
- `[mining]`: Pool fee, donation settings, and `pooltag_prefix`.
- `[logging]`: `debug` enables verbose runtime logging, and `net_debug` enables raw network tracing (`net-debug.log`) when debug logging is active.

Set numeric values explicitly (do not rely on automation), and trim whitespace (goPool trims internally but a clean config is easier to audit). Restart goPool after changing mining, payout, listener, node, storage, service, or connection-policy settings. `SIGUSR2` is only a partial runtime reload and is not a substitute for a restart; see the warning under [Runtime operations](#runtime-operations).

### Split Override Files

Optional split override files can layer advanced settings without touching the main config:

- `services.toml`: service/integration settings:
  `auth` (Clerk URLs/session cookie), `backblaze_backup` (backup service settings), `discord` (Discord URLs/channels + worker notify threshold), `status` (`mempool_address_url`, `github_url` links).
- `[rate_limits]`: `max_conns`, burst windows, steady-state rates, `stratum_messages_per_minute` (messages/min before disconnect + 1h ban), and whether to auto-calculate throttles from `max_conns`.
- `[timeouts]`: `connection_timeout_seconds` controls the Stratum miner idle timeout; set it to `0` to disable idle disconnects.
- `[mining]` in `policy.toml`: share-validation policy toggles (`share_*` settings) plus `submit_process_inline`.
- `[difficulty]`: `default_difficulty` fallback when no suggestion arrives, `max_difficulty`/`min_difficulty` clamps (0 disables a clamp), whether to lock miner-suggested difficulty, and whether to enforce min/max on suggested difficulty (ban/disconnect when outside limits). The first `mining.suggest_*` is honored once per connection, triggers a clean notify, and subsequent suggests are ignored.
- `[mining]`: `extranonce2_size`, `template_extra_nonce2_size`, `job_entropy`, `coinbase_scriptsig_max_bytes`, and `disable_pool_job_entropy` to remove the `<pool_entropy>-<job_entropy>` suffix. Assigned Stratum difficulty is rounded to whole numbers at difficulty `>= 1` for broad miner compatibility; fractional difficulty is only used below `1`.
- `[hashrate]`: `hashrate_ema_tau_seconds`, `share_ntime_max_forward_seconds`.
- `[peer_cleaning]`: Enable/disable peer cleanup and tune thresholds.
- `[bans]`: Ban thresholds/durations, `banned_miner_types` (disconnect miners by client ID on subscribe), and `clean_expired_on_startup` (defaults to `true`). Prefer `data/config/miner_blacklist.json` for client ID blacklist management; it overrides `banned_miner_types` when present. Set `clean_expired_on_startup = false` if you want to keep expired bans for inspection.
- `[version]` in `policy.toml`: `min_version_bits` (advertised/negotiated bit count, not a per-share changed-bit requirement), `share_allow_out_of_mask_version_bits` (allows legacy submits outside the negotiated mask), and `share_allow_degraded_version_bits` (retained compatibility flag).
- `version_bits.toml`: explicit `[[bits]]` overrides for block header version bits (`bit=<0..31>`, `enabled=true|false`). This file is read-only from goPool's perspective and is never rewritten; listed overrides have final authority per bit.

Keep these files absent to use built-in defaults. The first run creates examples under `data/config/examples/`.

### secrets.toml

Keep sensitive data out of `config.toml`:

- `rpc_user`/`rpc_pass`: Only used when `-allow-rpc-creds` is supplied (deprecated). The preferred path is `node.rpc_cookie_path`.
- `discord_token`, `clerk_secret_key`, `clerk_publishable_key`, `backblaze_account_id`, `backblaze_application_key`.

`secrets.toml` is gitignored and should live under `data/config`. The example is re-generated on each restart for reference.

## Node, RPC, and ZMQ

goPool expects a Bitcoin Core node with RPC enabled. Configure:

- `node.rpc_url`: The RPC endpoint for `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock`.
- `node.rpc_cookie_path`: Point this to `~/.bitcoin/.cookie` (or equivalent). When empty, goPool auto-detects common locations and, when successful, writes the discovered path back into `config.toml`.
- `-allow-public-rpc`: Allow connecting to an unauthenticated RPC endpoint (testing only).
- `-rpc-cookie`/`-rpc-url`: Use these overrides for temporary testing (e.g., a local regtest instance).
- `-allow-rpc-creds`: Forces `rpc_user`/`rpc_pass` from `secrets.toml`. goPool logs a warning every run and you lose the security of the cookie file workflow.

To change network defaults, use the `-network` flag:

- `mainnet`, `testnet`, `signet`, `regtest` — only one may be set per run. goPool applies RPC and ZMQ port defaults, RPC URL overrides, and sets `cfg.mainnet/testnet/...` booleans used for validation.

### ZMQ block updates

goPool can use Bitcoin Core's ZMQ publisher to learn about new blocks quickly. A direct-successor `rawblock` notification can activate a valid subsidy-only, coinbase-only job immediately while the full `getblocktemplate` remains in flight. The full Core template then replaces that job without invalidating shares from the empty job.

The empty fast path is enabled for mainnet (and regtest validation) and fails closed unless goPool has an exact cached header-time window and can prove the raw block directly extends the template currently being mined. It is skipped for reorgs, missed notifications, difficulty/versionbits boundaries, signet, reduced-difficulty networks, or incomplete history. In every skipped case, normal RPC/longpoll template refresh continues unchanged.

`node.zmq_hashblock_addr` and `node.zmq_rawblock_addr` control the ZMQ subscriber connections. When both are empty goPool disables ZMQ and logs a warning that you are running RPC/longpoll-only; this lets regtest or longpoll-only pools skip configuring a publisher. When a network flag (`-network`) is set and both are blank, goPool auto-fills the default `tcp://127.0.0.1:28332` for that network.

If you publish `hashblock` and `rawblock` on different ports, configure:

- `node.zmq_hashblock_addr` for `hashblock`
- `node.zmq_rawblock_addr` for `rawblock`

If both are set to the same `tcp://IP:port`, goPool will share a single ZMQ connection.

#### What goPool subscribes to

goPool subscribes to these Bitcoin Core ZMQ topics:

- `hashblock`: triggers an immediate template refresh when `rawblock` is unavailable. When a configured `rawblock` feed is healthy, goPool gives the matching raw payload a short, bounded opportunity to activate the guarded empty job first; if that payload is missing or malformed, `hashblock` starts the full-template refresh itself.
- `rawblock`: records block-tip telemetry, activates the guarded coinbase-only fast job when safe, and triggers the full template refresh.

Only `hashblock` and `rawblock` affect job freshness.

#### Minimal topics (without affecting mining correctness)

To avoid losing anything that affects mining/job freshness:

- Publish/subscribe **at least one** of `hashblock` or `rawblock` so goPool refreshes immediately on new blocks.

Common choices:

- **Lowest bandwidth:** enable only `hashblock`.
- **More block-tip telemetry without extra RPC:** enable `rawblock` (and optionally also `hashblock`).

#### Why longpoll still matters

Even with ZMQ enabled, goPool still uses RPC longpoll to keep templates current when the mempool/tx set changes. ZMQ tx topics are not used to refresh templates today, so if you disable longpoll you may stop picking up transaction-only template updates (fees/txs) between blocks.

## Status UI, TLS, and listeners

The status UI uses two listeners:

- `server.status_listen` (default `:80`) — serves HTTP, static files, and JSON endpoints.
- `server.status_tls_listen` (default `:443`) — serves HTTPS with auto-generated certificates (stored in `data/tls_cert.pem` and `data/tls_key.pem`).

Set `status_tls_listen = ""` to disable HTTPS and keep only the HTTP listener. Set `status_listen = ""` to disable HTTP entirely and rely solely on TLS. The CLI no longer provides an `-http-only` toggle.

For Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, goPool creates and serves `data/certbot-webroot/.well-known/acme-challenge/` on the status HTTP listener before HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects. Use `scripts/certbot-gopool.sh --webroot` with the default webroot, or point certbot at the same directory manually. The bundled UI files under `data/www` are embedded into the goPool binary and are separate from this runtime certbot webroot.

goPool also auto-creates `/stats/` and `/api/*` handlers plus optional TLS/cert reloading. Run `systemctl kill -s SIGUSR1 <service>` to reload the templates (the previous template set is kept when parsing fails). `SIGUSR2` re-reads the configuration files without stopping the daemon, but only publishes part of the new configuration at runtime; see the warning under [Runtime operations](#runtime-operations).

## Admin Control Panel

`data/config/admin.toml` is created automatically the first time goPool runs. The generated file documents the panel, defaults to `enabled = false`, and ships with `username = "admin"` plus a random password (check the file to copy the generated secret). Update the file to enable the UI, pick a unique username/password, and keep it out of version control. The `session_expiration_seconds` value controls how long the admin session remains valid (default 900 seconds).

goPool now stores a `password_sha256` alongside the plaintext password. On startup, if `password` is set, goPool verifies/refreshes `password_sha256` to match it. After the first successful admin login, the plaintext `password` is cleared from `admin.toml` and only the hash remains; subsequent logins use the hash.

When enabled, visit `/admin` (deliberately absent from the main navigation) and log in with the credentials stored in `admin.toml`. The panel exposes:

* **Live settings** – a field-based UI that updates goPool's in-memory configuration immediately. Some settings still require a reboot to fully apply across all subsystems.
* **Save to disk** – optionally force-write the current in-memory settings to `config.toml`, `services.toml`, `policy.toml`, and `tuning.toml`.
* **Reboot** – a button that sends SIGTERM to goPool. It requires re-entering the admin password and typing `REBOOT` to confirm the action so your pool does not restart accidentally.

Because the admin login is intentionally simple, bind this UI to trusted networks only (e.g., keep `server.status_listen` local-domain, use firewall rules, or run behind an authenticated proxy) and rotate credentials whenever you rotate administrators.

## Mining specifics

- `mining.pool_fee_percent`, `operator_donation_percent`, and `operator_donation_address` determine how rewards are split.
- `pooltag_prefix` customizes the `/goPool/` coinbase tag (only letters/digits).
- `job_entropy` and `pool_entropy` help make each template unique; disable the suffix with `tuning.toml` `[mining] disable_pool_job_entropy = true`.
- Share validation checks are explicit toggles in `policy.toml` `[mining]`:
  - `share_require_authorized_connection` defaults to `true`.
  - `share_job_freshness_mode` defaults to `1` (options: `0=off`, `1=job_id`, `2=job_id+prevhash`).
  - `share_check_param_format` defaults to `true`.
  - `share_check_ntime_window` and `share_check_version_rolling` default to `true`.
- `share_check_duplicate` defaults to `true` and enables duplicate-share detection (same job/extranonce2/ntime/nonce/version on one connection).
- `share_require_worker_match` defaults to `false`; enable it if you want strict submit/authorize worker-name matching.
- `submit_process_inline` defaults to `false`. Enabling it can reduce submit latency by processing `mining.submit` inline instead of queueing work.
- `vardiff_enabled` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` to keep connection difficulty static unless explicitly changed.

## Logging and diagnostics

Log files live under `data/logs/`:

- `pool.log` – structured log of pool events.
- `errors.log` – captures `ERROR` events for quick troubleshooting.
- `net-debug.log` – recorded when debug logging + network tracing are enabled (`[logging].debug=true` and `[logging].net_debug=true`, or `-debug -net-debug`); contains raw requests/responses and raw RPC/ZMQ traffic.

Use `-stdout` to mirror every entry to stdout. Pair that with `journalctl` or container logs for live debugging.

The internal `simpleLogger` writes a daily rolling file per log type, rotating after three days (configurable via `const logRetentionDays`).

## Backups and bans

goPool maintains its state in `data/state/workers.db`. For Backblaze uploads, it takes a consistent SQLite snapshot first (using SQLite's backup API). If you enable a local snapshot (`keep_local_copy = true` or set `snapshot_path`), goPool also writes a persistent snapshot you can back up safely (for example `data/state/workers.db.bak`).

### Backblaze B2

Configure `services.toml` `[backblaze_backup]`:

```toml
[backblaze_backup]
enabled = true
bucket = "my-bucket"
prefix = "gopool/"
interval_seconds = 43200
keep_local_copy = true
snapshot_path = ""
```

Store credentials in `secrets.toml` and keep them secure.

If Backblaze is temporarily unavailable at startup (network outage, transient auth failure), goPool keeps writing local snapshots (when enabled) and will retry connecting to B2 on later backup runs without requiring a restart.

### Ban cleanup

Expired bans are rewritten on every startup by default. Control this via `policy.toml` `[bans].clean_expired_on_startup` (defaults to `true`). Set it to `false` to inspect expired entries without clearing them.

Clean bans happen inside `NewAccountStore` as it opens the shared state DB; when disabled, you still get bans loaded from disk, but expired entries remain visible via the status UI.

## State database and snapshots

If you need a “safe to copy while goPool is running” database file, enable a local snapshot via `[backblaze_backup].keep_local_copy` (defaults the snapshot to `data/state/workers.db.bak`) or `[backblaze_backup].snapshot_path`. That snapshot is written atomically during each backup run.

When `[backblaze_backup].enabled = true`, goPool always writes a local snapshot (defaulting to `data/state/workers.db.bak` when `snapshot_path` is empty) so you still have a reliable local backup even if B2 is temporarily unavailable.

If you do not have a snapshot configured, stop the pool before copying `data/state/workers.db`. Avoid opening the live DB with external tools while goPool is running.

The `data/state/` directory also holds ban metadata, saved workers snapshots, and any auto-generated JSON caches—keep it alongside your main `data/` backup strategy.

## Tuning limits

Auto-configured accept rate limits calculate `max_accept_burst`/`max_accepts_per_second` based on `max_conns` unless `tuning.toml` overrides them. Recent defaults aim to allow all miners to reconnect within `accept_reconnect_window` seconds.

Key runtime knobs:

- `accept_burst_window` / `accept_reconnect_window` / `accept_steady_state_*` – windows that shape burst vs sustained behavior.
- `hashrate_ema_tau_seconds` – tune EMA smoothing for per-worker hashrate.
- `share_ntime_max_forward_seconds` – tolerated future timestamps on shares (default 7000 seconds).
- `peer_cleaning` – enable/disable and tune thresholds for cleaning stalled miners.
- `difficulty` – clamp advertised difficulty, optionally enforce min/max on miner-suggested difficulty, and optionally lock miner suggestions.

Each override value logs when set, so goPool operators can audit what changed via `pool.log`.

## Runtime operations

- **SIGUSR1** re-parses the embedded HTML templates and refreshes the embedded static cache. Errors are logged but the previous template set remains active so the site keeps serving—check `pool.log` if pages look odd after a reload.
- **SIGUSR2** re-reads `config.toml`, `secrets.toml`, `services.toml`, `policy.toml`, `tuning.toml`, and `version_bits.toml`, reapplies overrides, updates the status server's configuration snapshot, changes the runtime log level, and toggles network-debug logging. Future miner connections consume parts of that new snapshot.
- **Shutdown** occurs on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`. goPool stops the status servers, Stratum listener, and pending replayers gracefully.
- **TLS cert reloading** uses `certReloader` to monitor `data/tls_cert.pem`/`tls_key.pem` hourly. Certificate renewals (e.g., via certbot) are picked up without restarts.

> **Warning — `SIGUSR2` is a partial reload.** It does not rebuild the job manager or replace its payout and job-building policy, reconfigure listeners or node/ZMQ clients, update the reconnect limiter, rebuild long-lived services, or change already-connected miner sessions. After `SIGUSR2`, the status UI and future connections can therefore reflect new settings while active sessions and generated jobs still use old settings. This mixed state is especially unsafe to rely on for payout-address, fee, donation, coinbase, extranonce, version-bit, or other mining-policy changes. Restart goPool to apply those changes coherently. Use `SIGUSR2` only when that partial behavior is understood and acceptable.

## Monitoring APIs

- `/api/overview`, `/api/pool-page`, `/api/server`, `/api/node`, `/api/pool-hashrate`, and `/api/blocks` provide the public JSON snapshots consumed by the UI. Disable all JSON APIs with `-no-json`.
- `/user/<wallet>` and `/stats/<wallet>` are standard wallet lookup routes.
- `/users/<wallet_sha256>` is the privacy variant of wallet lookup (keeps raw wallet values out of links/bookmarks).
- `/stats/` serves the saved-worker dashboards, including per-worker graphing data.
- Authenticated JSON routes (`/api/saved-workers*`, `/api/discord/notify-enabled`, `/api/auth/session-refresh`) back saved-worker and Clerk/Discord flows when enabled.

## Profiling and debugging

- `-profile` writes `default.pgo`; use `go tool pprof` or `./scripts/profile-graph.sh default.pgo profile.svg` to inspect the profile and generate SVGs.
- Watch `/api/pool-page` and `/api/server` for RPC/share error counters and feed-health drift.
- `net-debug.log` records RPC/ZMQ traffic when debug logging + network tracing are enabled (`[logging].debug=true` and `[logging].net_debug=true`, or `-debug -net-debug`).
